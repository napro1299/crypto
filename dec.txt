Now we have seen all the steps needed to take a 128-bit block of data and transform it into ciphertext. We also looked at the reverse process for decryption. The process of encryption can be summarized as shown in Figure A.3. The mathematics behind the algorithm is rather hard to understand for nonmathematicians and we have focused on how rather than why in this book. If you are interested in such matters, it is probably worth reading the theoretical papers of looking at the book that specialize in cryptography. What is interesting, however, is the way in which all the operations are based on byte values and operations that are simple to implement in digital logic gates. AES achieves the goal of being both secure and practical for real systems.
